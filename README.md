# MUCOS: Detecting Common Actions in Motion Capture Data and Videos

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66032-mucos

This code is a simple implementation of OF COMMONALITY DETECTION METHOD PROPOSED IN [1]
Given an distance matrix (D) of two action sequences, our method discovers all pairs of similar subsequences, i.e. subsequences that represent the same action.
This is achieved in a completely unsupervised manner, i.e., without any prior knowledge of the type of actions, their number and their duration. These common subsequences (commonalities) may be located anywhere in the original sequences, may differ in duration and may be performed under different conditions e.g., by a different actor.

We will appreciate if you cite our papers [1, 2] in your work:
